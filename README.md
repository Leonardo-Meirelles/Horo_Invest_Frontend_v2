# Horo Invest v2

This is our fictitious company Horo Invest, now in its 2.0 version, that operates on the brazillian stock market, as well as cryptocurrencies and expecting future inclusion of currencies.

Now there are two types of users: regular user and admin.

The user can create a profile, using email and password, and place orders for cryptocurrencies and stocks. The user can also search through his/her orders, delete them and change the login credentials (still being implemented).

The admin can manage cryptos and stocks, include or delete them and search all the user in the database.

Mobile responsiveness is still being implemented.

This project is of our own, and we made it during the Infnet Fullstack (MERN) Bootcamp :)
